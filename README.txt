This script is still under development, use it at your own risk!!!

It is made such as:

Take 01 - Take 02 = Take 03

Where:

Take 01: is the animation itself.
Take 02: the animation to be substracted (a walk pose for example)
Take 03: take where the subtraction will be applied.

All takes should have the same lenght.
